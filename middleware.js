// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

// Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:---
// Execute any code.
// Make changes to the request and the response objects.
// End the request-response cycle.
// Call the next middleware in the stack.

// req => middleware => res

// if a middleware function is made and it does not have a res to send back then, we need to pass it to another middleware using 'next' else it will block the page...
